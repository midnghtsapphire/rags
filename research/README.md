## How to Use This Folder

### When Starting a New Domain Project:

1. **Check if research exists** - Look for `claude-[domain]-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. **Review recommendations** - Models, architecture, costs
3. **Add to todo list** - Create task in `/projects/tasks/todo.md`
4. **Create stack when ready** - Move to `/projects/oz/stacks/` if needed
5. **Update this README** - Mark status as "Active"

### When Adding New Research:

1. **Name format:** `claude-[domain]-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. **Include:** Source, date, status, models, opportunities, costs
3. **Add to this README** - Keep index updated
4. **Tag priority** - Use ⭐ for high-opportunity domains

## Notes

- This is your "someday/maybe" for domain-specific LLM projects
- All research is dated so you know when it was created
- Update status when you start working on a domain
- Don't create stacks until you're actively working on the domain
- Keep this README updated as you add new research
