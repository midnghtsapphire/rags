# Brain Dump

**Purpose:** Capture EVERY random idea, thought, or inspiration the moment it hits—no filtering, no organizing, no judgment.

## How to Use

### Throughout the Day
1. Open today's brain dump file (format: `YYYY-MM-DD-braindump.md`)
2. Add your idea under the appropriate section (or create a new one)
3. Don't worry about:
   - Whether it's a good idea
   - Where it fits in existing projects
   - If it's complete or makes sense
   - Duplicates or contradictions

### Quick Capture Format
```
## [TIME] - Quick thought
- Idea goes here
- Context if needed
- Related project (if you know it)
```

### End of Day Processing
At the end of each day (or when you're ready):
1. Review your brain dump
2. Identify actionable items
3. Run the daily processing workflow (see `/projects/tasks/README.md`)
4. Archive the brain dump file

## Why This Works for ADHD

**Separation of Capture and Processing:** Your brain can dump ideas without the executive function tax of organizing them immediately.

**Prevents Project Sprawl:** Ideas go here first, not scattered across 50 different project folders.

**Reduces Anxiety:** Nothing gets lost. Everything has a home.

**Daily Reset:** Each day starts fresh, but nothing is forgotten.

## File Naming Convention

- Daily dumps: `YYYY-MM-DD-braindump.md`
- Example: `2026-01-30-braindump.md`
