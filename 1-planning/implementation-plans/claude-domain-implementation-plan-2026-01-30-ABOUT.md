## Claude's Key Recommendations

### PRIORITY 1: Social Security & Disability

Claude identified this as the **highest-value, lowest-competition opportunity**:

> "Build the first SSA-specialized LLM. No competitors exist. This ONE product justifies the entire investment."

**Why Claude prioritized this:**
1. **Blue ocean** - Zero specialized competitors
2. **High value** - Disability attorneys desperately need this
3. **Defensible moat** - First-mover advantage + domain expertise barrier
4. **Clear ROI** - Break-even in 7-9 months

**Claude's recommended approach:**
- Fine-tune Llama 3.3 70B on POMS, Blue Book, case law
- Target: 12,000 disability law firms in US
- Pricing: $299-1,999/month per firm
- Start with RAG MVP, then fine-tune if validated

### Quick Wins (Week 1-4)

Claude outlined immediate actions:

**Week 1:**
- Start SSA data scraping (POMS, Blue Book)
- Set up development environment
- Begin customer discovery

**Week 2-4:**
- Interview 10-20 disability attorneys
- Validate pain points
- Assess willingness to pay
- Build simple RAG prototype

**Month 2:**
- Launch RAG-only MVP
- Beta test with 5 attorneys
- Collect feedback
- Measure time savings

**Month 3-6:**
- Full fine-tuning if validation succeeds
- Scale to 50 beta users
- Iterate based on feedback
- Prepare for commercial launch
