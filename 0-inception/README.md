## When to Skip Steps

### You can skip:
- **Provisional patent** if you're not worried about someone stealing your idea
- **Full patent** if your innovation is not novel or defensible
- **Trademark** initially (but do it before launch)
- **Attorney fees** if you're comfortable with DIY (use LegalZoom, Rocket Lawyer)

### You CANNOT skip:
- **EIN** - Required for hiring, banking, taxes
- **Business entity registration** - Required to operate legally
- **Bank account** - Required to separate personal/business finances
- **Accounting system** - Required for taxes and financial management

---

## Red Flags

### Stop and reconsider if:
- ❌ No one will pay for your solution (failed validation)
- ❌ Existing patents block your approach (need licensing or pivot)
- ❌ Can't afford $2K minimum to start legally
- ❌ Don't have 2-4 weeks to dedicate to setup

## Notes

- This phase is often overlooked but is CRITICAL for grants and investors
- Grants require proof of legal entity (EIN, registration)
- Investors want to see you've protected IP
- IRS penalties for improper tax setup can be severe
- Do NOT skip this phase to "move fast" - it will cost you later
